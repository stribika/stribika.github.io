Neighbors, please join me in reading this ninth release of the International
Journal of Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out, a friendly little collection of
articles for ladies and gentlemen of distinguished ability and taste in the
field of software exploitation and the worship of weird machines. If you are
missing the first eight issues, we the editors suggest pirating them from the
usual locations, or on paper from a neighbor who picked up a copy of the first
in Vegas, the second in São Paulo, the third in Hamburg, the fourth in
Heidelberg, the fifth in Montréal, the sixth in Las Vegas, the seventh from his
parents’ inkjet printer during the Thanksgiving holiday, or the eighth in
Heidelberg. This is our second epistle to Montréal, because we love that city
and its fine neighbors.

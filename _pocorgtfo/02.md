Please join me in reading this third issue of the International Journal of Proof
of Concept or Get the Fuck Out, a friendly little collection of articles for
ladies and gentlemen of distinguished ability and taste in the field of software
exploitation and the worship of weird machines. If you are missing the first two
issues, we the editors suggest pirating them from the usual locations, or on
paper from a neighbor who picked up a copy of the first in Vegas or the second
in São Paulo.
